This shows all zoning cases that have changed status to "Scheduled for Hearing" in the Urban Core of Austin. Many of them are upzonings. If you click on a marker, it will show relevant information about that case such as a link to the address in google maps, the case file in the city's database, any past or upcoming meetings that are scheduled for this case, and the contact email for the case manager so you can email them an comments you may have.

Please use this power to support more housing in the Urban Core to create more opportunities for all kinds of people and stop the unsustainable sprawl before we all die from global warming. Thanks.
